Implements such function: DisplayAllBlocks, NewBlock, ModifyBlock (create packages and import all the libraries)
Make two Branches (Dev and main), In the main branch, merge the dev branch content (Go source file).
Practice all the Github Comands from the git-hub cheat-sheet.
Make sure to add the readMe file in the repo, where write all the comands that you used.

Step by Step:

Write the code to implement the required functions (DisplayAllBlocks, NewBlock, ModifyBlock) in this file.
Create Branch "Dev".
Commit the Go Source File.
Go to "Main" Branch and create a pull request. Approve it.
